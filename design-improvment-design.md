## Multi-Armed Bandit Design Review

### I. Disadvantages of the Current Design

1. **Redundant Methods**
The current Bandit abstract base class (ABC) has methods like experiment and report that might not be universally applicable to all bandit algorithms. This forces every subclass to implement these methods, even if they don't naturally fit the algorithm's logic. A universal update method might not capture the unique nuances of each algorithm, leading to potential inefficiencies or inaccuracies. The current design tightly couples the algorithm's core logic with data reporting and visualization. This could make modifications cumbersome and impact maintainability. The methods in the Bandit abstract base class do not dictate specific implementations, just signatures. However, having methods like experiment and report in the ABC might force a certain kind of implementation in derived classes, which can be seen as a violation of DIP. These methods are more about the details of how specific algorithms might be tested or how results might be reported, which should ideally be separate from the core bandit logic.

### II. Violations of SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** 
    - The Bandit ABC is responsible for both the core bandit logic (pull, update) and reporting (report, experiment). This violates SRP, as the class has multiple reasons to change.
  
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Adding new bandit algorithms or modifying existing ones requires changes to the base class, especially when the new algorithms don't fit the method signatures of the ABC.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Due to the forced inclusion of methods like experiment in every subclass, it's possible that some subclasses might implement it in a way that breaks the expected behavior when substituted for the base class.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    - The ABC forces subclasses to implement methods they might not need (experiment, report), making the interface too heavy and not truly representative of a generic bandit.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    - The design tightly couples the high-level modules with specific method implementations of the ABC, potentially hindering flexibility and adaptability. This could be improved by relying more on abstractions and less on concrete details within the base class.

### III. Proposed Improvements

1. **Reallocation of Methods**
 Move the report method out of the Bandit ABC to a separate Reporter class or module. This decouples the reporting logic from the bandit logic, adhering to SRP. The experiment method can be made more generic in the base class or moved to specific subclasses if its implementation varies significantly across algorithms. 

2. **Application of Design Patterns**

    - **Strategy Pattern**
        - **Purpose** Encapsulate different MAB algorithms as interchangeable strategies.
        - **Benefit** Facilitates easy extension of the system with new algorithms without modifying the existing codebase.

    - **Factory Pattern**
        - **Purpose** Centralize the creation of bandit instances, allowing the system to provide the correct bandit type based on input or configuration.
        - **Benefit** Streamlines the instantiation process and ensures consistency across the application.

    - **Observer Pattern**
        - **Purpose** Notify auxiliary components (like visualization tools) in real-time as the bandit algorithms progress.
        - **Benefit** Decouples main algorithm from auxiliary components and allows real-time updates.

    - **Template Pattern**
        - **Purpose** Define the general flow of bandit algorithms in the base class, allowing specific steps to be overridden by subclasses.
        - **Benefit** Ensures a consistent structure across different algorithms and promotes code reusability.

### IV. Conclusion

Incorporating the proposed design improvements and patterns will elevate the system's architecture, promoting flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility. This will not only align the design with best practices but also make future modifications and extensions more straightforward and efficient.
