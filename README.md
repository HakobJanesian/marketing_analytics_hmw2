# In order to execute the main part of the code, simply run the main.py script.
After running the main.py, all the visualizations will be shown.

# Key Components
main.py: The main script to run and visualize the comparison results.
implementations: Contains the core implementation of both algorithms.
logs: Contains the logging utility to capture and display experiment results.
plotting: Provides various plotting and visualization functions to show the results.
interfaces: The interfaces for the two algorithms (EpsilonGreedy and ThompsonSampling).
results: Here, there are the results of the two algorithms (EpsilonGreedy and ThompsonSampling) kept in CSV files.

# I have also used pyment for documentation.
